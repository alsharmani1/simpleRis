FIRST AND FOREMOST THE ONLY REASON WE ARE INCLUDING OUR SECRET KEYS HERE IN THE REPOSITORY WITH THE .env FILE IS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A REAL APPLICATION AND THE DB WILL BE DELETED ONCE THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN DELIVERED. IN THE REAL WORLD THIS IS A HUGE SECURITY RISK SO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

I created this db so we don't have to download or configure the db on our machines manually. It will be deleted once we are done with the project.
