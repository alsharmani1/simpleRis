I created this db so we don't have to download or configure the db on our machines manually. It will be deleted once we are done with the project.

To login to the db with our express server we will use
DB Name/Username: simpleRIS
DB_NAME: simpleRIS-35331188
DB password: simpleRIS123
DB Server: shareddb-b.hosting.stackcp.net

To login to phpMyAdmin and view the db go to:

https://phpmyadmin.stackcp.com/

Enter the information below

Server: shareddb-b.hosting.stackcp.net
Username: simpleRIS
password: simpleRIS123
